                    <p>There are five broad groups of wētās:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Tree wētā</li>
                            <li>Ground wētā</li>
                            <li>Cave wētā</li>
                            <li>Giant wētā</li>
                            <li>Tusked wētā</li>

                        <br>
                    <p>Diet: Wētā are mainly herbivorous in the wild, but are also known to eat insects.
                    Habitat: They are nocturnal and live in a variety of habitats including grassland, shrub land, forests, and caves. They excavate holes under stones, rotting logs, or in trees, or occupy pre-formed burrows.</p>

            <p>Many different species
                The Giant wētā/wētāpunga of Little Barrier is the biggest, and the Nelson alpine wētā the smallest at 7 grams.
                The Mahoenui giant wētā, long considered extinct on the mainland, was rediscovered in a patch of King Country gorse in 1962.
                Species of wētā continue to be discovered. One of the three tusked species, the carnivorous Jaws', was found by lizard expert Tony Whittaker on Middle Mercury Island off the Coromandel Coast 29 years ago; another of them in the Raukumara Ranges on the East Coast of the North Island as recently as 1995.
                Several species that were once found on mainland New Zealand are now only found on offshore islands. Very little is known about these offshore island populations.
                Many of the giant species now only survive on protected land and many are endangered. Little is known about the past distribution of wētā.</p>

            <h2>Threats</h2>
            <p>The decline of most wētā is due to three major causes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Predation: Wētā have evolved alongside native predators such as birds, reptiles, and bats. The introduction of predators such as rats, mustelids, cats, and hedgehogs has resulted in a sharp increase in the rate of predation.</li>
                    <li>Habitat destruction: Caused by human impacts</li>
                    <li>Browsers: Modification of weta habitat caused by browsers.</li>
