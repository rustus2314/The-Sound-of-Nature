                    <p class="speech-text2">Before widespread tree milling and logging, weta habitats in New Zealand forests were diverse and rich in resources. Wetlands, where wetas thrived, had dense forest canopies with leaf litter, fallen branches, and rotting wood, providing ideal shelter. Old-growth forests with mature trees and a variety of microhabitats offered shelter and breeding sites. Wetas preferred high humidity and shaded conditions, which helped them avoid drying out, and the diverse vegetation provided ample food sources. Logging and tree milling have significantly impacted these habitats, leading to conservation efforts aimed at preserving them.</p>

The removal of mature trees reduces canopy cover, exposing the forest floor to more sunlight and creating hotter, drier conditions unsuitable for wetas. Logging also eliminates critical microhabitats like rotting logs and tree hollows, reducing shelter and breeding sites. Habitat fragmentation and soil erosion further disrupt weta populations, while invasive species and increased predation add additional pressures. Conservation efforts aim to restore these degraded areas and protect remaining habitats to support weta recovery.</p>

                    <p class="speech-text2">After mass spraying of weeds in forests, weta habitats often face significant degradation. The reduction in plant diversity from herbicide use eliminates native vegetation crucial for wetas, reducing their food sources and shelter. Loss of ground cover and increased soil erosion further destabilize the environment, making it less hospitable for wetas. The destruction of microhabitats and disruptions in the food web also impact their survival. These changes, along with increased exposure to predators, make the environment less suitable for wetas, highlighting the need for habitat restoration and management efforts..</p>
